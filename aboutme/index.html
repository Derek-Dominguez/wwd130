    <h2>Derek Dominguez</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone, I'm Derek! I'm from Utah and I am excited for this class. I got
        married to my wife Sydney since October of 2021 and we are both studying online at BYU-Idaho! I am 
        currently working full time as an Optician at an Eye Doctors office and I love it! (most days) Obviously it
        doesn't have a ton to do with what I am currently studying but it's the perfect place for me to be right now. 
        To be honest, the main reason I am taking this course is because there are many occupations and careers where the skills
        and tools that we learn with software and web development can be very helpful, I personally don't have an exact goal for my future
        career but I believe there is a lot of versatality in these courses! </p>
    <p> Here are a bunch more of random facts about me, I love to read, hang out with my family and friends, spend extra time with my wife, and playing any and all types of games. I also love hiking, roller coasters, and swimming at the beack!</p>
    <p> I look forward to getting to know the rest of you throughout this semester as we all work and learn together.</p>
