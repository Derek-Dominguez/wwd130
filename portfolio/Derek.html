        <h3>My Background: I am native to Utah and have have acquired a variety of experience and skills in several varied industries including Customer Service, Education, Healthcare, Aesthetics, and even Fast Food, my variety of experience in a wide array of fields has provided me with the ability to work well in and understand in a plethora of different subjects and environments, this skill aids me in being able to create content for a variety of different fields and industries. In my life, even before I was a teenager I developed a passion for theatre, and live stage performance which provided me with insight into the creative process and developed a drive in me to give the best performance that I can give, this drive led me to win a variety of awards at Regional and Statewide levels. This drive to “give my best performance” has influenced and followed me into my professional life, though I may not be singing and dancing on stage currently, my drive to put forth my best possible performance has played a part in my projects as you are able to see in my showcase portfolio.</h3>

        <h3> Education (last updated June 2023): My education is still ongoing, I am a newcomer to the world of Web Development and I understand that my lack of experience may be at first glance, a detriment to my credibility, but rather than looking at my lack of serious experience, focus more on my fresh and unique style, many other developers might have a lot of tricks and previous experience, but they also have fallen into patterns and routine, I am still developing and new, I don’t have any outdated methods or routines, I am learning new things every day and each project I work on is unique.</h3>
