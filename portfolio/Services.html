            <h2> Client Image - A Reflection of Your Own Values: If I were to design a website for you, you should know that I prioritize understanding a client's needs and I strive to create websites that are a perfect reflection of your own values. I want the work I do to present a client's values, aesthetic, and vision. I will collaborate directly with you to create a tailor-made image that best represents a client's personal or corporate image. This level of collaboration sets my work apart from many others as I will deliver a customized approach to every project. Regardless of style or industry, my versatility and ability to adapt will help you find that perfect image/identity, my portfolio has been carefully curated to show the diversity and range of the images and themes I can create, a clear demonstration that no matter what image you want to have of yourself I can deliver.</h2>
