        Derek’s Showcase- A personal portfolio website to present examples of my creative works and professional achievements. This platform is to provide visitors with a comprehensive overview of my skills and talents.Whether you are a potential employer, collaborator or simply someone who is interested in my work, I invite you to explore this site to gain an understanding of my abilities, personal background, and goals. 

        Purpose: In addition to providing links and examples to some of my previous work I hope my portfolio website itself will serve as a gateway to  showcase my ability to create a memorable browsing experience, my distinctive creative design, and my  professionalism. If you have any questions about the  work I am capable of, this portfolio may be able to answer those questions, whether they be about my creative ability, my organizational capabilities, or my attention to detail.

      <h3>Services </h3>
      <p> Client Image - A  Reflection of Your Own Values: If I were to design a website for you, you should know that I prioritize understanding a client's needs and I strive to create websites that are a perfect reflection of your own values. I want the work I do to present a client's values, aesthetic, and vision. I will collaborate directly with you to create a tailor-made image that best represents a client's personal or corporate image. This level of collaboration sets my work apart from many others as I will deliver a customized approach to every project. Regardless of style or industry, my versatility and ability to adapt will help you find that perfect image/identity, my portfolio has been carefully curated to show the diversity and range of the images and themes I can create, a clear demonstration that no matter what image you want to have of yourself I can deliver. 


        Collaborator and Consultant: While the primary purpose of the site is to display my own work, I am also open to collaboration and consultation, if you are interested in collaborating on a project together, or if you are merely interested in my opinion as a creative consultant you can easily connect with me with my provided contact information.

      <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
      <p>
        My Background: I am native to Utah and have have acquired a variety of experience and skills in several varied industries including Customer Service, Education, Healthcare, Aesthetics, and even Fast Food, my variety of experience in a wide array of fields has provided me with the ability to work well in and understand in a plethora of different subjects and environments, this skill aids me in being able to create content for a variety of different fields and industries. 
        In my life, even before I was a teenager I developed a passion for theatre, and live stage performance which provided me with insight into the creative process and developed a drive in me to give the best performance that I can give, this drive led me to win a variety of awards at Regional and Statewide levels. This drive to “give my best performance” has influenced and followed me into my professional life, though I may not be singing and dancing on stage currently, my drive to put forth my best possible performance has played a part in my projects as you are able to see in my showcase portfolio. 
        Education (last updated June 2023):  My education is still ongoing, I am a newcomer to the world of Web Development and I understand that my lack of experience may be at first glance, a detriment to my credibility, but rather than looking at my lack of serious experience, focus more on my fresh and unique style, many other developers might have a lot of tricks and previous experience, but they also have fallen into patterns and routine, I am still developing and new, I don’t have any outdated methods or routines, I am learning new things every day and each project I work on is unique.
