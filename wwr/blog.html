        <blogcontent>MIGRATION SEASON! Our trips are run in some of the most remote areas of The United States, so naturally we share these areas with wildlife both large and small, The Park Service generally asks that you give a wide berth and to not disturb to any critters you encounter, however we have been seeing large migrations of Big Horn Sheep moving through many of the areas where we tour. While these beautiful animals are beautiful and to many symbolize the rugged mountain west, they can be dangerous if they feel threatened. While the chances to encounter these sheep are low, we ask that in order to keep yourself, and the animals safe, if you encounter a big horn sheep, do not agitate it, and stay at least 100 feet away. Give them enough room to escape if they feel threatened.</blogcontent>
